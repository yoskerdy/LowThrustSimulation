PMI_angle.py :
This program was created to simulate the target surface angle depending on the distance calculated at 3 different points.
This distance is evaluated thanks to 3 lasers.

PMI_simulation_ralentissement_orbital.py :
This program is the main one, it is a simulation of the low thrust effect on the target satellite (we can se that the orbits changes).

TLE_reader.py :
This is a short program that allows us to extract interesting data from a TLE format text.
